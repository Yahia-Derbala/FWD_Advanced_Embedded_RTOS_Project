Implementing EDF Scheduler on FreeRTOS.

Earliest Deadline First (EDF) is a shecduling algorithm that adopts a dynamic priority-based preemptive scheduling policy, meaning that the priority

of a task can change during its execution, and the processing of any task is interrupted by a request for any higher priority task.

In this project I am designing an EDF scheduler based on FreeRTOS.
